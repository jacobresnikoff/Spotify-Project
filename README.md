# Spotify-Project
Within this repository is an Exploratory Data Analysis and Machine Learning project. The main sections are complete, and I am currently revising the finer details of the report.

## Repository Structure
- The [checkpoints](https://github.com/jacobresnikoff/spotify-project/tree/main/checkpoints) directory contains csv outputs from each section. Because of the size of the dataset, it occasionally takes a long time for my machine to run each section. For the sake of time efficiency, I have created csv output files for each of the numbered sections within the report. This makes editing code faster for me by eliminating the need to rerun the notebook repeatedly.
- The data[https://github.com/jacobresnikoff/spotify-project/tree/main/data] directory contains the song data I am using. The original dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/yamaerenay/spotify-dataset-19212020-160k-tracks).
- The [python](https://github.com/jacobresnikoff/spotify-project/tree/main/python) directory contains the project itself. It is formatted as a Jupyter Notebook, and is viewable on GitHub directly.
